<h2 id="article3">Can Universal Basic Income be brought to fruition?</h2>

    <p id="ubiNews"> 
        I first I heard about it when I was talking to friends in academia.  
        The next place I heard about it is from Mark Zuckerberg, 
        
        founder of Facebook.  After actually paying attention to what Mark had to say, I actually like the idea.  
        The concept of being able to live with a standard basic income that pays all the essentials for living. There definitely 
        would be a problem coming from the Republicans.  They would say how would you pay for it.  That is a good question.  
        The only way I can think of is to raise taxes.  </p>
        
        <p id="ubiNews">
      To raise taxes would cause some people to be livid, but maybe if the taxes were raise correctly.  When I say correctly, I'm pertaining to 
     raising taxes on people that can afford it.  The people that could afford something like this would, well I'm certain they would fight back in 
     some way.  I know we would probably see a lot of money being given to the Republican party.  With that terrible decision by the court on Citizens 
     United, the amount we are talking is simply tons of cash.  Since it's such a big change, the backlash would probably be close to the Obamacare 
     level or bigger.  </p>

<p id="ubiNews"> 
    The advantages of this law I think far outweigh the disadvantages.  I think this bill would be very helpful to a lot of people who would like 
    to try new things.  One of the main things I can think of is not liking your job and being able to become an entrepreneur.  Since this bill would 
    pay the essentials, a person would be able to learn something new without the fear of losing everything.  Say for instance, if someone wanted to 
    code, they could take out the time from their schedule necessary and learn.  People who wanted to work on new inventions would be able to. The 
    disadvantages I can see is some individuals not wanting to do anything and just playing the role of a bum.  Another disadvantage I can see from 
    this bill is the higher taxes.  Like I said before the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages. It would be a period of excitement.  If this 
    bill were to pass it would create a period that could be labeled the New Renaissance.  This bill basically would give the individual the ability 
    to create.
